<p style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Deforestation, the clearing or thinning of forests by humans. Deforestation represents one of the largest issues in global land use Estimates 
of deforestation traditionally are based on the area of forest cleared for human use, including removal of the trees for wood products and for croplands and 
grazing lands. In the practice of clear-cutting, all the trees are removed from the land, which completely destroys the forest. In some cases, however, 
even partial logging and accidental fires thin out the trees enough to change the forest structure dramatically.Conversion of forests to land used for 
other purposes has a long history. Earthâ€™s croplands, which cover about 49 million square km (18.9 million square miles), are mostly deforested land.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;background-color:green">*Modern deforestation*  </p>
<p style="color:red;background-color:yellow">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the annual rate of deforestation is about 1.3 million square km per decade, though 
the rate has slowed in some places in the early 21st century as a result of enhanced forest management practices and the establishment of nature preserves. 
The greatest deforestation is occurring in the tropics, where a wide variety of forests exists. They range from rainforests that are hot and wet year-round to 
forests that are merely humid and moist, to those in which trees in varying proportions lose their leaves in the dry season, and to dry open woodlands. Because 
boundaries between these categories are inevitably arbitrary, estimates differ regarding how much deforestation has occurred in the tropics.</p>
